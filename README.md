# index.html <br>
The 'html' tag defines the root of the HTML document and includes the lang="en" attribute, indicating that the content is in English.  <br>
The'head' section contains meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, as well as the page title, which appears in the browser tab. <br>
The 'link' tag references an external CSS file named "styles.css" to apply styling to the HTML elements. <br>
The 'body' section contains the content of the web page. <br>
An 'h1' heading displays the title "CSS Color Markers." <br>
A 'div' with the class "container" wraps the three colored markers. <br>
<br>

# style.css
The CSS file contains various styling rules for the elements in the HTML document.
The 'h1' element is centered using text-align: center;. <br>
The .container class defines the styling for the container that wraps the markers, setting a white background and some padding. <br>
The .marker class sets the dimensions and margin for the colored markers. <br>
The .cap class defines the width and height of the marker's cap (top part). <br>
The .sleeve class defines the width, height, background color, and left border of the marker's sleeve (bottom part). <br>
The .red, .green, and .blue classes define different gradient backgrounds and box shadows for each colored marker. <br>
